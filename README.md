# HTML starter template for project 

In this project i am creating a starter template for creating an HTML project

### What's included in this starter template

* Bootdtrap 4 
* JQuery 3.5.1


#### Why use this template

If you have multiple files to link with your different html files then you might get tired to link it multiple time . Now you can link your css or html once in [head](header.html) file . 

It reduce your coding time by allowing you to call [header file](header.html) and [footer file](footer.html) anywhere in html using jQuery So you don't have to write header and footer again and again

Write your header and footer once and you can call it inside any html page
